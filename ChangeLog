	* Fixed the problem in the ConvZDateTime private member function
	where the TZ environment variable was not being reset on failures.
	
	* Modified the ADRMessageType class ConvZDateTime private member
	function so that it now returns the local time as it should rather
	than GMT.

2005-04-21 Andrew De Ponte <cyphactor@socal.rr.com>
	
	* Modified the ADRMessageType class ConvZDateTime private member
	function to properly convert the Zaurus format in a cross-platform
	manner as well as one which now works in all time zones.

	* Modified the RDWMessageType class ConvCalTime private member
	function to properly convert the time_t calendar time into the
	Zaurus format in a cross-platform manner as well as one which now
	works in all time zones.

	* Fixed some typos in the SetCalendarItemParam() member function
	of the ZaurusType class so that it will parse the ADR messages
	correctly.

2005-04-17 Andrew De Ponte <cyphactor@socal.rr.com>
	
	* Replaced the AddTodoItem(), ModifyTodoItem(), and GetTodoItem()
	private member functions of the ZaurusType class with versions
	that use the GetTodoItemParam() and SetTodoItemParam()
	functions. The original working functions are still in the code,
	just commented out until testing has been performed and Todo
	synchronization is successful.
	
	* Implemented the GetTodoItemParam() private member function in
	the ZaurusType class.
	
	* Implemented the SetTodoItemParam() private member function in
	the ZaurusType class.
	
	* Modified the SetCalendarItemParam() private member function of
	the ZaurusType class to use the DATA_ID access functions that were
	just added to the ADRMessageType class.
	
	* Added the DATA_ID access functions to the ADRMessageType class
	and added byte order swapping where needed to make it cross-platform.

2005-04-16 Andrew De Ponte <cyphactor@socal.rr.com>

	* Fixed const correctness for the CardParamInfoType class.
	
	* Fixed const correctness for all classes in the zdata library.
	
	* Updated the doxygen comments in the RDWMessageType class.
	
	* Modified the AddCalendarItem member function of the ZaurusType
	class to use the new GetCalendarItemParam function.
	
	* Modified the ModifyCalendarItem member function of the
	ZaurusType class to use the new GetCalendarItemParam function.

	* Modified the GetCalendarItemParam private member function of the
	ZaurusType class to use the new version of the RDWMessageType
	class. This makes the GetCalendarItemParam function cross-platform
	with respect to byte order as well as eliminates code duplication.
	
	* Added the Bit, Time, ULong, Barray, UTF8, UChar, and Word append
	member functions to the RDWMessageType class eliminating code
	repetition and provide a common standard interface handeling
	conversion and byte order swapping.
	
	* Coppied ConvCalTime from the ZaurusType class into the
	RDWMessageType class as a private member function so that it may
	be used internally. ConvCalTime still needs to be removed from the
	ZaurusType class however all of its calls inside the ZaurusType
	class need to be removed.
	
	* Added support to the RDWMessageType class to now allow total
	creation of RDW messages using the class rather than it being a
	stub class. This provides seperation of conversions and byte
	swapping to allow for a better design in a cross-platform design
	as well as eliminating a large amount of code duplication.
	
	* Modified the SwapByteOrder() function of zmsg library to be more
	inteligent so that it no longer performs the malloc unless both
	pointers point to the same memory address.
	
	* Added byte order support to the RDWMessageType class in the zmsg
	class.

2005-04-07 Andrew De Ponte <cyphactor@socal.rr.com>

	* Added byte order support to the required classes of the zmsg
	library so that it is cross-platform with respect to the byte order.

	* Modified the SwapByteOrder() function of the zmsg library to
	allow for the src and dst parameters to point to the same memory.
	
	* Added the IsBigEndian() function to the zmsg library to provide
	a cleaner interface than the already existent by GetHostByteOrder().
	
	* Added the IsLittleEndain() function to the zmsg library to provide
	a cleaner interface than the already existent by GetHostByteOrder().
	
	* Added the SwapByteOrder() function to the zmsg library so that
	the cross-platform problems dealing with byte order may be resolved.

2005-04-03 Andrew De Ponte <cyphactor@socal.rr.com>

	* Added the PerformCalendarSync function to zync without conflict
	resolution support so I could test it.

	* Modified the SendRSS function of the zmsg library to use the
	RSSMessageType class which allows for specifying of
	synchronization type.
	
	* Added the RSSMessageType class to the zmsg library.
	
	* Fixed a line in CalendarPluginType.hh file where a function
	prototype was defined to return a AddrBookItemType rather than a
	CalendarItemType.

2005-03-28 Andrew De Ponte <cyphactor@socal.rr.com>

	* Altered zync.cc to work with the name changes of create_t and
	destroy_t for all of the plugins.
	
	* Changed the create_t and destroy_t types to create_todo_t,
	create_addr_t, and create_cal_t respectively as well as for the
	destroy_t types within the Plugin template class headers so that
	there are no name conflicts. This will require that the zync.cc be
	changed to work with this but it shouldn't be to much of a change.
	
	* Created the CalendarPluginType.hh class specification file so
	that there is a rigid base template class existing for Calendar
	plugins.
	
	* Implemented the GetAllCalendarSyncItems() public member function
	of the ZaurusType class.

2005-03-27 Andrew De Ponte <cyphactor@socal.rr.com>

	* Implemented the AddCalendarItems() public member function of the
	ZaurusType class.
	
	* Implemented the ModCalendarItems() public member function of the
	ZaurusType class.
	
	* Implemented the DelCalendarItems() public member function of the
	ZaurusType class.
	
	* Implemented the AddCalendarItem() private member function of the
	ZaurusType class using the GetCalendarItemParam() private member
	function.
	
	* Replaced the stub version of the GetCalendarItemParam() private
	member function of the Zaurus class with the fully implemented
	version of the function.
	
	* Implemented the ModifyCalendarItem() private member function of the
	ZaurusType class using the GetCalendarItemParam() private member
	function stub.

2005-03-16 Andrew De Ponte <cyphactor@socal.rr.com>

	* Implemented the GetCalendarItem() private member function of the
	ZaurusType class using the SetCalendarItemParam() private member
	function.
	
	* Fully implemented the SetCalendarItemParam() private member
	function of the ZaurusType class.
	
	* Changed the repeatPeriod and repeatPosition members of the
	CalendarItemType class to an unsigned short given that it is
	stored as a word which is 2 bytes. I also adjusted all associated
	access functions to follow.
	
	* Changed the alarm time member of the CalendarItemType class to
	an unsigned short given that it is stored as a word which is 2
	bytes. I also adjusted all it's associated access functions to
	follow.
	
	* Tested the new obtain parameter information code that is used to
	obtain the data format using the protocol. It looks to be working
	fine in normal sync and should work fine in full sync as well.
	
	* Fixed a byte offset in the GetParamAbrev() member function of
	the ADIMessageType class of libzmsg.

	* Created a function that prints the list of the cards param info
	as soon as it is obtained to make sure that it was obtained correctly.
	
2005-03-14 Andrew De Ponte <cyphactor@socal.rr.com>

	* Implemented the ObtainParamInfo() call into the
	PerformTodoSync() function of the zync application. I tested this
	in normal sync mode and it seems to be working fine. I have NOT
	tested it in full sync mode yet, however it should work and will
	no doubt get tested at some point in the future.
	
	* Created a public member function of the ZaurusType class called
	ObtainParamInfo() which uses the Zaurus synchronization protocol
	to obtain the parameter information used to populate the
	paramInfoList private member variable.
	
	* Created a private member of the ZaurusType class of type
	CardParamInfoType::List. This list will be used as a reference for
	the data format used in exchanges between the Zaurus and the
	Desktop for a specific type of synchronization.
	
2005-02-22 Andrew De Ponte <cyphactor@socal.rr.com>

	* Created the CardParamInfoType class and defined type
	CardParamInfoType::List to allow for dynamic creation of a list of
	all the associated cards parameter info. This will allow more
	robustness for future versions of the protocol as well as a better
	method for parsing card data.
	
	* Added the ADIMessageType class to the zmsg library so that
	receiving of ADI messages can be easier as well as parsing the
	data from them.
	
	* Added the RDIMessageType class to the zmsg library so that
	creation and sending of RDI messages is easy.

2005-02-15 Andrew De Ponte <cyphactor@socal.rr.com>

	* Changed the ZaurusType::DeleteTodoItem() private member function
	to ZaurusType::DeleteItem() given that it is more generic and
	works the same way for all types of synchronizations. There, is no
	need to have three functions which do the same thing. I also
	adjusted the ZaurusType::DelTodoItems() public member function to
	call ZarusType::DeleteItem() rather than the old
	ZaurusType::DeleteTodoItem() private member function.

	* Implemented the GetCalendarItem() private member function in the
	ZaurusType class so that I may use it in the implementation of the
	GetAllCalendarSyncItems() public member function.

2005-02-10 Andrew De Ponte <cyphactor@socal.rr.com>

	* Created a dox_docs directory and a Doxyfile for each of the zync
	components for which doxygen documents can be created.
	
	* Finished implementing the CalendarItemType class and added it to
	the build process in the Makefile as well as the install process
	and clean process of the Makefile.

2005-02-10 Andrew De Ponte <cyphactor@socal.rr.com>

	* Started writing the CalendarItemType class for the zdata
	library. It is not finished yet, the properly implemented portion
	is the top half seperated by a number of blank lines.

--- 0.2.6 Released

2005-02-07 Andrew De Ponte <cyphactor@socal.rr.com>

	* Rewrote the one step Full Sync code, and tested it with the new
	KOrgTodoPlugin which now uses CalendarLocal again rather then
	CalendarResources.

	* Updated zync to use the new unique create and destroy functions.

	* Changed the Todo and Address Book template classes to have
	unique create and destroy functions as to not topple each other in
	certain cases while loading plugins.

2005-01-25 Andrew De Ponte <cyphactor@socal.rr.com>

	* Fixed the Todo Notes to Desc translation problem when syncing
	after a full sync.

	* Enabled the one step Full Sync code, and tested it with the new
	KOrgTodoPlugin that uses CalendarResources rather than
	CalendarLocal, success!!!!!!
	
2005-01-21 Andrew De Ponte <cyphactor@socal.rr.com>

	* Added the Todo Plugin CleanUp call to Full Sync.

	* Modified the Makefile to install the man page.
	* Fixed a bunch of typos and grammer problems in the man page.
	* Moved the example.zync.conf and updated the README for it.
	* Added a Makefile to the conf dir to install the example conf.
	* Modified the Makefile to install COPYING, README, AUTHORS, etc.
	* Fixed a number of bugs dealing with failure in loading the
	config.
	* Added temporary Full Sync two step method so people can sync if
	they have never synchronized before.

2005-01-07 Andrew De Ponte <cyphactor@socal.rr.com>

	* Added the example.zync.conf to the root directory.
	* Modified the README to cover the passcode config option.
	* Modified the library Makefiles to call /sbin/ldconfig.

2005-01-04 Andrew De Ponte <cyphactor@socal.rr.com>

	* Created the AddrBookItemType.hh and AddrBookItemType.cc files in
	the zdata library. I have not fully implemented them. I just
	started them.

2005-01-03 Andrew De Ponte <cyphactor@socal.rr.com>

	* Added Authentication support.
